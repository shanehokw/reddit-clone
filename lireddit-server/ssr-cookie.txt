ssr 
    browser -> next.js -> graphql-api

client side request
    browser -> graphql-api

*browser will automatically send cookies to next one 
*in ssr browser sends to next.js server but next.js doesn't do anything with it. it's gone when next.js makes request to graphql-api
*so we make next.js server send cookie to graphql-api
