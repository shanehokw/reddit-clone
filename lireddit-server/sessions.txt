req.session.userId = user.id
â†“ take any data that is stuck on session object, save to redis
{userId: 1} -> save to redis. Redis is a key value store: use key to look up values

1
Key looks like this -> sess: fqfewprypwerw -> { userId: 1 } // maps to object

2
expres-session will set a cookie on my browser -> oiwrypqq98ypr89q3r983q3423r (encrypted version of key)

3
when user makes a request
oiwrypqq98ypr89q3r983q3423r -> sent to server

4
on browser, encrypted key is decrypted using secret that was set, back into key
oiwrypqq98ypr89q3r983q3423r -> sess: fqfewprypwerw

5
make a request to redis
sess: fqfewprypwerw -> { userId: 1 }

req.session = { userId: 1 }
