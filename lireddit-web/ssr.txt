when thinking about when to use Server Side Rendring (ssr) on your pages:
1. consider SEO, do you want google to know about any data? like posts, content to show up when googled
 a. doing any queries on the page?
 b. are those queries important for SEO?

dont use it when
1. there are things that would benefit from a slightly longer load time, eg: custom load effect
2. specific content to the user, where they must be logged in to access

how it works:
me -> make a request to browser http://localhost:3000
-> make a request to next.js server
-> make a request to graphql server localhost:4000 to grab all posts
-> building the HTML
-> sending back to browser

In next.js, after loading a first ssr page, pages after that will not be ssr (such as going Back to a page), because it does client side routing, 
because ssr is not done for pages that are already navigated
